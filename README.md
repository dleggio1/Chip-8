Chip-8 Emulator

Chip-8 emulator written in C as a fun project over the summer.
Nice refresher on topics I learned in my computer architecture courses! I plan to emulate the Game Boy and SNES next.

- chip8.c is responsible for the front-end and executable.
- cpu.c/h is responsible for running the chip8 cpu, managing memory, loading roms, etc.
